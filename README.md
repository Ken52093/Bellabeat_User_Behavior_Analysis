## Description

This is a data analysis project focused on analyzing smart device fitness data from Bellabeat to gain insights into user behavior and trends. The goal is to identify potential growth opportunities for Bellabeat and guide their marketing strategy.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis was obtained from multiple CSV files provided by Bellabeat. The following datasets were used:
- `dailyActivity_merged.csv`: Daily activity data of users, including steps, distance, active minutes, and calories burned.
- `sleepDay_merged.csv`: Sleep data of users, including total sleep records, total minutes asleep, and total time in bed.
- `weightLogInfo_merged.csv`: Weight log data of users, including weight measurements over time.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following key insights:

1. **Activity Level Patterns:** A line graph showing the average steps per day over time reveals fluctuations in user activity levels.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights several important trends and insights that can guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy. Users seem to prefer lightly active and sedentary exercises, indicating an opportunity to focus on providing features that cater to these preferences. Additionally, the data suggests that users' sleep duration and weight can be positively impacted by using the app or device.

In terms of attracting new users and retaining existing ones, our data suggests the following strategies:

1. Create beginner-friendly content and features.
2. Enhance manual input features for better user engagement.
3. Highlight the potential benefits to sleep patterns and weight loss in marketing materials.

## Future Work

For future improvements, Bellabeat could consider conducting more in-depth analyses to understand the factors influencing sleep duration fluctuations and user engagement with the app. Furthermore, the company could explore personalized features based on user preferences and health goals.
