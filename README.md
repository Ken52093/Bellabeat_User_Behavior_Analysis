3. **Weight Loss Over Time:** An encouraging trend observed is that the average weight of the users has decreased over time.

This trend can be highlighted in the marketing efforts to attract new users.

4. **Average Sleep Duration Over Time:** The analysis reveals fluctuations in sleep duration over the study period, with no clear trend observed. This could be attributed to external factors affecting sleep patterns or users adjusting to the sleep tracking feature of our app or device. Investing in understanding these variations could lead to better insights and allow us to provide enhanced tips and features that help users improve sleep consistency.
